def autotag(content_object, text):
    """
    Takes a given block of text and tags it according to models and fields defined in settings:

    AUTOTAG_CONTENT = (
      {
        'model'      : 'schools.school',
        'field'      : 'school',
        'check'      : 'is_active',
        'm2m_field'  : 'articles',
        'reverse_m2m': 'politicians',
       },
       ... etc ...
    )

    THE FIELDS...
    model:
        the app and model to check
    field:
        the particular field/value you are matching in the text
    check:
        an optional field to filter by. Maybe. If we can figure out how to do it...
    m2m_field:
        Optional. Will add the current object to a m2m field on the remote object.
        For example, if you are auto_tagging schools in articles
        you can add the article to the schools "articles" field.
    reverse_m2m:
        Optional. Will add the remote object to a m2m field on the current object.
        For example, politicians can be a m2m on articles in some cases.
        If you were tagging politicians in articles, this would add the politician
        to the article's  "politicians" field.

    Do NOT attempt to use both m2m and reverse_m2m on the same thing.
